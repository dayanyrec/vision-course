\title{Computer Vision Lab \#1: Pointwise Image Processing} 

\author{Ricardo Fabbri and Others}


Your goal of this first lab is to 

\begin{itemize}
\item Familiarize with the Scilab image
processing toolbox (SIP).
\item Implement pointwise image processing operations such as thresholding,
sampling, quantization, and enhancements
\end{itemize}

The images you will need for the lab can be downloaded from the course
